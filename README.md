The aim of this project is to show the implementation of some trajectory planning techniques for a Differential Drive from a start point to a goal point in a known environment with obstacles. Once the specific trajectory is computed with the chosen technique, the user could choose the specific control law for the trajectory tracking. 

Trajectory planning techniques:
1) Artificial Potential Fields (APF)
2) Artificial Potential Fields Discretized (APFD)
3) Visibility Graph
4) Voronoi Diagram
5) Point-to-point trajectory

Control laws:
1) Linear control
2) Non-linear control
3) Feedback linearization control
